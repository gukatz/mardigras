        <h2>About Mardi Gras</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement.<br> It's one big holiday in
                New
                Orleans!<br>

                Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn
                themselves
                with
                long
                beads
                caught from the floats of previous parades.<br> You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with
                their
                families
                are
                everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time.<br> Parade goers will sit on
                the
                ground,
                throw
                balls,
                play
                music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades.<br> On Mardi Gras day, the
                majority
                of
                non-essential
                businesses are shut down because of the celebration.<br>

                Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                trinkets
                they
                will
                catch from the parades!</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>On Mardi Gras in 1827, a group of students danced through the streets wearing bright costumes. They
            wanted
            to bring the rowdy festivities they’d seen in Paris on Mardi Gras. The first recorded New Orleans
            Mardi
            Gras parade took place ten years later in 1837. Since then, the carnival continues to this day. It’s
            even a
            state holiday in Louisiana and they’re the only US state to make it a legal holiday.<br>

            Over the years, the New Orleans Mardi Gras traditions began to evolve into what we know today.
            Crowds
            of
            masked revellers paraded through the streets, riding horseback, pulling carriages and carrying
            gaslight
            torches.<br>

            The first Mardi Gras krewe formed in 1856. Known as the Mistick Krewe of Comus, they organised
            incredible
            rolling floats, marching bands and masked balls. The second Mardi Grewe formed 14 years later in
            1870.
            They
            were called the Twelfth Night Revelers and were the first to introduce the historic Mardi Gras
            “throws”.<br>

            In 1872, the Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff visited New Orleans. A group of local businessmen
            organised
            the first Mardi Gras daytime parade, to entertain the Grand Duke and the citizens of New Orleans. It
            was
            lead by Rex, the “King of Carnival”, in honour of the Grand Duke. Since then, krewes have remained
            an
            iconic
            part of the Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans.</p>

        <h2>Traditions</h2>

        <h4>The Traditional Colors</h4>
        <p>The history of Mardi Gras’ traditional colours began when the Russian Grand Duke visited New Orleans.
            The
            Krewe of Rex wore the Grand Duke’s family colours – green, gold and purple – in honour of his
            arrival.<br>

            The Grand Duke’s welcoming committee also handed out green, gold and purple beads to the
            party-goers.
            They remain the iconic colours of Mardi Gras today and have been given meanings: green for faith,
            gold
            for power, and purple for justice.</p><br><br><br>
        <img src="images/Featured-Mardi_Gras_King-Cake.jpg" class="img-main" alt="The King Cake Picture">
        <h4>The King Cake</h4>
        <p>The King Cake is a traditional dessert made for Mardi Gras. The origins of the cake date back to
            medieval times, when European cultures celebrated the 12th day of Christmas with sweets and gifts.
            In the bible, the kings of the time would have visited the newborn Jesus, bringing sweets and gifts
            of their own, and that’s why the cake is called King Cake.
            <br>
            Today, the King Cakes are doughy, fried and frosted pastries, made in the traditional Mardi Gras
            colours. They’re also circular and braided to represent a King’s crown, and baked with a baby
            figurine inside. Whoever finds the baby, must host the next party!</p><br><br><br>
        <img src="images/queen-zulu-parade-float-mardi-gras-new-orleans-1.jpeg" alt="The Krewes Float Picture"
            class="img-main">
        <h4>The Krewes</h4>
        <p>Today there are more than 70 secret societies, or krewes, that take part in Mardi Gras celebrations.
            The krewes build floats around their theme and roll down the streets on parade days. They sometimes
            even feature a celebrity guest to entertain the crowds.
            Some krewes restrict their membership to one gender, while others allow co-ed membership. For example, the
            Krewe
            of Endymion from New Orleans and Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla from Tampa are currently restricted to men
            only. Examples of female only krewes include the New Orleans' Krewe of Cleopatra and Krewe of Muses and
            Tampa's Krewe of Venus.</p><br><br><br><br>
        <img src="images/5e55b63654caa.image.jpg" class="img-main" alt="Throwing Trinkets From The Float">
        <h4>The "Throws"</h4>
        <p>Each float famously gives out “throws”, or party favours, to the crowd. The throws range from the
            gold coins given by the Krewe of Rex, to the coconuts given by the Krewe of Zulu. Almost
            everyone also throws colourful beads. It’s a great honour to receive a throw, and the
            traditional way of asking for throws is to shout “Throw me something, mister”. Remember to bring
            a big bag so you can haul away all the trinkets you catch from the floats!

        <h2>Invitation from the Mayor of New Orleans - LaToya Cantrell</h2>

        <p>As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to experience the excitement
            of Mardi Gras!<br>
            The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 - the Feast of the
            Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading
            up to the big event.<br>

            Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
            Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
            goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"<br>

            The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid
            & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes
            add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.<br>

            New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
            be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their
            lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say,
            "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"<br><br>

            Sincerely,<br>

            LaToya Cantrell<br>
            Mayor of New Orleans</p>
