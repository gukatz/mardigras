                <summary>Do I need tickets to Mardi Gras?</summary>
                <p class="text">While you can buy tickets to some Mardi Gras Balls and for great seats in viewing
                    stands
                    around the city, most Mardi Gras events and all parades are free. That’s why it’s called
                    “The
                    greatest
                    free show on Earth.”</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How should I dress for parades?</summary>
                <p class="text">While some people decide to costume all the time, you’ll always be fine in jeans,
                    a
                    T-shirt,
                    and close-toed shoes. Mardi Gras colors (purple, green and gold) are encouraged.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>What’s weather like on Mardi Gras?</summary>
                <p class="text">It’s can be warm, chilly, dry or wet. Be prepared to wear layers, especially if
                    you’re
                    planning on catching both day and night parades. Also, if the weather has been rainy,
                    waterproof
                    footwear are a good idea. The parade route (especially on the neutral ground side) can get
                    muddy.

            <details>
                <summary>What’s the best way to get around during Mardi Gras?</summary>
                <p class="text">The fastest way to get around during Mardi Gras is on foot. The streetcars run
                    during
                    Mardi Gras season but those along parade routes have limited hours and routes.

            <details>
                <summary>Is Mardi Gras a family friendly event?</summary>
                <p class="text">Kids make Mardi Gras and have the most fun of all -- maybe. Our recommendation
                    for
                    families is to hit the more family-friendly (and local) Uptown parade route along St.
                    Charles
                    Avenue.

                <summary>Why do krewe members in parades wear masks?
                </summary>
                <p class="text">Masking became a tradition because during early Carnivals, people put on masks to
                    be
                    able to mingle outside their class and keep their reputation untarnished. Float riders are
                    required
                    to wear masks by law in keeping with the mystery and tradition, and many krewes never reveal
                    who
                    their king or queen is.

            <details>
                <summary>What’s the deal with the ladders?
                </summary>
                <p class="text">Families park their ladders along the parade routes so their children can see the
                    parades and catch lots of beads and stuffed animals, and not get lost in the crowd.

            <details>
                <summary>Where can I eat and drink along parade route?
                </summary>
                <p class="text">There are a ton of restaurants located along (or near) the parade routes. There
                    are
                    also
                    a number of food stands that pop up during the season, including food trucks.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is there restroom access along the parade routes?
                </summary>
                <p class="text">Public port-a-potties are available for free or for a small fee all along the
                    parade
                    routes. Usually businesses will allow you to use a restroom if you are a customer or pay a
                    small
                    fee
                    as well. Use a port-a-potty or you’ll end up in a paddy wagon. Public urination is illegal
                    and
                    Mardi
                    Gras is no exception.

                <summary>How early should I book flights and hotels?
                </summary>
                <p class="text">As fast as possible! Flights and hotels fill up very fast and get more expensive
                    closer
                    to the date.
